**Visual cheat done for research purposes.**

Currently works only on 1920x1080 (best option) and 1280x720 game resolution!

Config must be in the same folder as the exe to make it work!

This project includes features such as no-recoil, aimbot and triggerbot built using Python and DearPyGui.

6. **Compiling**

   I highly recommend obfuscating the .exe as it can be detected, but here are the basic compilation instructions.
   Open a command prompt IN DIRECTORY WITH ALL SCRIPTS and run the following command to compile all files to exe:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

   then, run
   
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile main.py norecoil.py aimbot.py triggerbot.py autoswap.py bhop.py
   ```
