## Quick Installation (Recommended)

Run `build.bat` and it will make all the work for you. (Ensure that Python is installed and added to your system's PATH beforehand.)

## Manual Installation

1. **Install Python**
   
   Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   Be sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Open a terminal or command prompt, then run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install dearpygui mss numpy pywin32 pyautogui keyboard opencv-python pynput
   ```   
## Obfuscating and compiling

To obfuscate the files using pyarmor:
```
pip install pyinstaller pyarmor
```

Open a command prompt in the directory with all scripts and run:
```
pyarmor gen --pack onefile main.py
```

Rename the resulting `dist/main.exe` file and use it.
