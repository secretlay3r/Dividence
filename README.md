## How to install
1. **Install Python**
   
   Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   Be sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Open a terminal or command prompt, then run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install dearpygui mss numpy pywin32 pyautogui keyboard opencv-python
   
3. **Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/secretlay3r/Dividence-for-Spectre-Divide/releases) and download latest version (it's not obfuscated so it's not safe to use!)**

## Obfuscating and compiling
 
To obfuscate the files using pyarmor, install it first:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller pyarmor
```

Open a command prompt IN DIRECTORY WITH ALL SCRIPTS and run the following command:
```bash
pyarmor gen --pack onefile main.py
```
Now you should have obfuscated main.exe in the dist folder, rename it and use.
